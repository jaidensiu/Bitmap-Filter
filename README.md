# Bitmap-Filter

This repository holds my code for a Bitmap Filter written in the C programming language. The program applies four filtering algorithms to bitmaps (BMP files): grayscale, reflection, blur, and edges. For the edges filter, I explored different AI algorithms such as edge detection algorithms that are used for image processing and computer vision applications. Some concepts used include the Sobel operator which consisted of two kernel matrices that computed RGB values for the edge filter.
